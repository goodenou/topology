Description: This research is focused on public opinion estimation in subnational
  geographies (e.g., states, cities, legislative districts), which frequently requires
  testing a high volume of models. Among these projects are ongoing work on estimating
  state-level public opinion from cluster-sampled historical surveys (e.g., https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gmyjh);
  estimating joint distributions of public opinion across multiple "questions"; and
  estimating public opinion at the state legislative district level.
