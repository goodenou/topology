Description: 'Researching ways to optimize our clinical trials from a statistical
  methodology standpoint. This includes ensuring that more patients can receive active
  experimental drugs that show promise, minimizing patient exposure to experimental
  drugs that are not working well, and also maximizing the likelihood of graduating
  experimental drugs that truly improve patient outcomes. This may require development
  of new statistical methodologies which are validated via simulation. More information
