Description: This project explores methods and architectures that use machine learning
  to predict and install network flows before they arrive at a software-defined networking
  (SDN) domain. In Reactive SDN, a new flow causes interaction between the SDN controller
  and the SDN switch. The goal of the project is to reduce the delay caused by these
  controller-switch interactions to process new flows.
