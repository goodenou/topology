Description: As the size of data explodes during the big data era, we develop a strategy
  to select more informative data points for building models to alleviate the computation
  burden. In contrast to previous studies on parametric models, our research explores
  the efficacy of optimal subsampling methods in gradient boosting trees, a semi-parametric
  method.
