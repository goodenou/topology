Description: Alternative promoter usage is a major mechanism that generates transcripts
  that vary between tissues and cell types, and contributes to cell differentiation
  and organ development. Detecting alternative promoter usage usually requires data
  generated from specialized protocols, such as Cap-analysis gene expression (CAGE),
  and hence there is less data to study promoter-level regulation. We propose to build
  a deep learning model that can predict alternative promoter usage based on standard
  RNA-seq data, instead of CAGE.
