Department: Department of Chemical Engineering
Description: My research (https://CoReACTER.org) broadly involves computational and
  data science studies of complex reactive systems. In the short-term, I intend to
  use the OSPool to generate training data for machine learned interatomic potentials
  (specifically, performing high-throughput DFT calculations of materials interfaces)
  and to perform high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations of solid-state reactivity.
  These efforts relate to a current project funded by Toyota Research Institute through
  their Synthesis Advanced Research Challenge.
