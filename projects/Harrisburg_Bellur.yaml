Description: This research proposes a Lightweight Modular Real-Time Weapon Detection
  Framework to improve weapon detection in crowded, dynamic environments by combining
  contextual frame filtering, people detection, and small object detection using advanced
  deep learning models. The framework focuses on reducing computational load while
  maintaining high detection precision, leveraging lightweight CNNs and Vision Transformers
  optimized for real-time edge deployment. By addressing challenges such as occlusion,
  crowd density, and small object detection, the study aims to significantly advance
  AI-driven surveillance systems for enhanced public safety.
