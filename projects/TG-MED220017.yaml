Description: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is the
  main cause of death from infectious diseases, other than COVID-19, leading to 1.3
  million deaths in 20203. The main pathological feature of TB disease is the formation
  of lung granulomas, dense collections of host immune cells, bacteria and dead cell
  debris. It is within these granulomas that the bacteria persist ad where the host
  immune system interacts with and responds to the bacterial infection4. Granulomas
  are highly complex structures that evolve over months to years within patients (Fig
  1A). In vivo studies in humans, primates and mice have elucidated many of the key
  mechanisms involved in longer-term granuloma function. In vitro experiments can
  recreate certain aspects of granulomas in the lab, by combining host immune cells
  and bacteria in cell cultures5. These in vitro systems allow for closer investigation
  of the early dynamics of granuloma formation, which are difficult to capture and
  measure experimentally in vivo in lung tissue. The downside of the more complex
  in vitro systems with multiple cell types and design variables, is that they are
  difficult to analyze and optimize. Our computational models support and accelerate
  the analysis and design of such complex in vitro systems, in close collaboration
  with experimental groups.
